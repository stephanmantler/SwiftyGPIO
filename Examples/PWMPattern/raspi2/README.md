# PWM Pattern Example with a WS2812B/NeoPixel Led Matrix

Generate animated patterns on a 8x8 WS2812B led matrix using the PWM pattern generator.

It shows how this feature can be used in practice to drive devices that use patterns to encode the 0s and 1s of the messages they use to communicate with the driver.
